`stacky` is a homebrewed tool to manage stacks of PRs. This allows developers to easily manage many smaller, more targeted PRs that depend on each other.


## Installation
You now have the choice on how to do that, we build pre-packaged version of stacky on new releases, they can be found on the [releases](https://github.com/rockset/stacky/releases) page and we also publish a package in `pypi`.

### Pre-packaged

Using `bazel` we provide pre-packaged version, they are self contained and don't require the installation of external modules. Just drop them in a directory that is part of the `$PATH` environment variable make it executable and you are good to go.

There is also a [xar](https://github.com/facebookincubator/xar/) version it should be faster to run but requires to have `xarexec_fuse` installed.

### Pip
```
pip3 install rockset-stacky
```

### Manual
`stacky` requires the following python3 packages installed on the host 
1. asciitree
2. ansicolors
3. simple-term-menu
```
pip3 install asciitree ansicolors simple-term-menu
```

After which `stacky` can be directly run with `./src/stacky/stacky.py`. We would recommend symlinking `stacky.py` into your path so you can use it anywhere


## Accessing Github
Stacky doesn't use any git or Github APIs. It expects `git` and `gh` cli commands to work and be properly configured. For instructions on installing the github cli `gh` please read their [documentation](https://cli.github.com/manual/).

## Usage
`stacky` stores all information locally, within your git repository
Syntax is as follows:
- `stacky info`: show all stacks , add `-pr` if you want to see GitHub PR numbers (slows things down a bit)
- `stacky branch`: per branch commands (shortcut: `stacky b`)
    - `stacky branch up` (`stacky b u`): move down the stack (towards `master`)
    - `stacky branch down` (`stacky b d`): move down the stack (towards `master`)
    - `stacky branch new <name>`: create a new branch on top of the current one
- `stacky commit [-m <message>] [--amend] [--allow-empty]`: wrapper around `git commit` that syncs everything upstack
    - `stacky amend`: will amend currently tracked changes to top commit
- Based on the first argument (`stack` vs `upstack` vs `downstack`), the following commands operate on the entire current stack, everything upstack from the current PR (inclusive), or everything downstack from the current PR:
    - `stacky stack info [--pr]`
    - `stacky stack sync`: sync (rebase) branches in the stack on top of their parents
    - `stacky stack push [--no-pr]`: push to origin, optionally not creating PRs if they don’t exist
- `stacky upstack onto <target>`: restack the current branch (and everything upstack from it) on top of another branch (like `gt us onto`), useful if you’ve made a separate PR that you want to include in your stack
- `stacky continue`: continue an interrupted stacky sync command (because of conflicts)
- `stacky update`: will pull changes from github and update master, and deletes branches that have been merged into master

The indicators (`*`, `~`, `!`) mean:
- `*` — this is the current branch
- `~` — the branch is not in sync with the remote branch (you should push)
- `!` — the branch is not in sync with its parent in the stack (you should run `stacky stack sync`, which will do some rebases)

```

### Sample Workflow 
1. Create a new working branch with `stacky branch new <branch_name>`. 
2. Update files and add files to git tracking like normal (`git add`)
3. Commit updates with `stacky commit -m <commit_message>`
4. Create a stacked branch with `stacky branch new <downstack_branch_name>`
5. Update files and add files in downstack branch (`git add`)
6. `stacky push` will create 2 PRs. Top branch will have a PR against master and bottom branch will have a PR against the top branch.
7. Update the upstack branch and run `stacky commit`. This will rebase changes in the upstack branch to the downstack branch
8. `stacky push` will update both the PRs.

## Tuning

The behavior of `stacky` allow some tuning. You can tune it by creating a `.stackyconfig`
the file has to be either at the top of your repository (ie. next to the `.git` folder) or in the `$HOME` folder.

If both files exists the one in the home folder takes precedence.
The format of that file is following the `ini` format and has the same structure as the `.gitconfig` file.

In the file you have sections and each sections define some parameters.

We currently have the following sections:
 * UI

List of parameters for each sections:

### UI
 * skip_confirm, boolean with a default value of `False`, set it to `True` to skip confirmation before doing things like reparenting or removing merged branches.
 * change_to_main: boolean with a default value of `False`, by default `stacky` will stop doing action is you are not in a valid stack (ie. a branch that was created or adopted by stacky), when set to `True` `stacky` will first change to `main` or `master` *when* the current branch is not a valid stack.
 * change_to_adopted: boolean with a default value of `False`, when set to `True` `stacky` will change the current branch to the adopted one.
 * share_ssh_session: boolean with a default value of `False`, when set to `True` `stacky` will create a shared `ssh` session to the `github.com` server. This is useful when you are pushing a stack of diff and you have some kind of 2FA on your ssh key like the ed25519-sk.
